# Image Colorization using GAN

This repository is the implementation done by me during my CSE 575: Statistical Machine Learning class's final project. Read the final report of our group <a href=''>here</a>

For all the implemetations done, refer to the <a href='https://github.com/RushangKaria/cse575_project'>GitHub repository</a>

I implemented GAN based architecture for coloring the black and white images. The implementation of the code is inspired by <a href='https://towardsdatascience.com/colorizing-black-white-images-with-u-net-and-conditional-gan-a-tutorial-81b2df111cd8'>this</a> article.
